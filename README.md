This python script is used to create new users, assign them user or root privileges, and generate a random password. It can also delete users and their entire home directory. 

The main script, kamtool.py, imports the script to create users 'KAM.py' and the script to delete users 'KAM2.py' and calls the appropriate function based on the users input.
